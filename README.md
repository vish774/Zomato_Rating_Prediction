# Zomato_Rating_Prediction

Problem Statement:
Zomato is one of the best online food delivery apps which gives the users the ratings and the reviews on restaurants all over india.These ratings and the Reviews are considered as one of the most important deciding factors which determine how good a restaurant is.
We will therefore use the real time Data set with variuos features a user would look into regarding a restaurant. We will be considering Banglore City in this analysis.

The main agenda of this project is:
Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Zomato Dataset. Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features DEPLOY the Machine learning model via Flask that can be used to make live predictions of restaurants ratings

Feature Engineering Steps:

Handle missing values
Encode categorical data into numerical data
Feature importance ==> heatmap, extratreeregressor
Splitting ==> train & test dataset
Apply models
Serialization/saving our model into pickle file
Deployment using Flask framework ==> other servers like(heroku,aws,azure,google cloud)


●	Responsibilities:

⮚	Created a new environment to avoid interference in project if any of the packages or libraries get updated in future.

⮚	Collected data from Kaggle.

⮚	Understood the insights of the data by doing extensive EDA by using various plotting techniques with the help of matplotlib and seaborn visualization libraries.

⮚	Performed various feature engineering techniques like handling missing values, cleaning the data, encoding categorical data into numerical data.

⮚	Plotted feature importance plots like Heatmap and ExtraTreeRegressor to find which features are important for the model and to find out the relationship between all the features.

⮚	Further divided the data into train and test splits in the ratio of 80% and 20%.

⮚	Applied various machine learning algorithms on the dataset and performed Hyper Parameter Tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomisedSearchCV to find out the best parameters.

⮚	Saved the model into a pickle file which is also known as Serialization.

⮚	Finally done deployment using flask framework.
