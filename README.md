# Zomato_Rating_Prediction

Problem Statement:
Zomato is one of the best online food delivery apps which gives the users the ratings and the reviews on restaurants all over india.These ratings and the Reviews are considered as one of the most important deciding factors which determine how good a restaurant is.
We will therefore use the real time Data set with variuos features a user would look into regarding a restaurant. We will be considering Banglore City in this analysis.

The main agenda of this project is:
Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Zomato Dataset. Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features DEPLOY the Machine learning model via Flask that can be used to make live predictions of restaurants ratings

Feature Engineering Steps:

Handle missing values
Encode categorical data into numerical data
Feature importance ==> heatmap, extratreeregressor
Splitting ==> train & test dataset
Apply models
Serialization/saving our model into pickle file
Deployment using Flask framework ==> other servers like(heroku,aws,azure,google cloud)
